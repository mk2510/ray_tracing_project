Pythonimplementation of the book [raytracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley. To improve rendertimes I added multiprocessing as well, so the render takes advantage of the full processing capability. The final scene rendered by my project looks like this:

The raytracer is simply started by calling:

```python
>>> python3 main.py
```
from the raytracing in a weekend folder.
The book "raytracing the next week" is also implemented here in python in a seperate folder named "raytracing_the_next_week". World 5 for example renders a sphere, which will be lighted by a rectangle.
